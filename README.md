# Uncommon JavaScript Error: Switch Statement and Input Handling

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in JavaScript related to switch statements and input handling. The original code lacks comprehensive handling for unsupported operators and non-numeric inputs, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and input validation.

## Bug Description

The primary issue lies in the `operate` function. The switch statement only handles the operators '+', '-', '*', and '/'. If an unsupported operator is provided (such as '%'), the function throws an error.  Furthermore, the code does not perform input validation to verify that the operands are numbers. 

## Solution

The solution addresses these issues by:

1. Adding a `default` case to the switch statement to handle unsupported operators more gracefully.
2. Implementing input validation to check if `a` and `b` are numbers.  If not, the function returns an error.

This improved error handling and input validation make the code more robust and prevent unexpected errors.
